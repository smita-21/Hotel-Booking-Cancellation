                                                 Hotel Booking Cancellation Data Analysis And Insights
About The Dataset: 

This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 2015 and 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.

Objective: 

The goal of this project is to find the reasons for the increased number of cancellations of hotel bookings and give the client suggestions that can help hotels minimize cancellations and increase guest satisfaction, ultimately leading to improved revenue and a stronger reputation in the industry. 

Tool:  

Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn  

Insights: 

Pricing strategies: Hotels can analyze the relationship between cancellation rates and pricing. By adjusting their pricing strategies, they can offer lower rates for specific hotels based on their locations or seasons. This can attract more bookings and potentially reduce cancellations. 

 

Weekend and holiday discounts: Since resort hotels have a higher cancellation ratio compared to city hotels, offering reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays can incentivize guests to book and reduce the likelihood of cancellations. Special promotions or packages tailored to these periods can also be effective. 

 

January campaigns: Given that January has the highest cancellation rate, hotels can launch targeted marketing campaigns during this month. Offering attractive deals, such as discounted rates or value-added services, can encourage guests to maintain their bookings and increase revenue during this period.  

 

Quality improvements: Focusing on improving the quality of hotels and services, particularly in Portugal where cancellations are prominent, can enhance guest satisfaction and reduce cancellations. This can include upgrading facilities, enhancing customer service, advertising, and actively addressing guest feedback to create a positive experience that encourages guests to keep their reservation.
